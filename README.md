# Python Exercises Collection

This repository contains a series of Python exercises organized into different categories (A, B, C, D) with multiple numbered scripts in each category. These exercises are designed to help beginners and intermediate-level Python developers improve their skills by working through various problems.

## Structure

The repository is structured into four main categories:

- **Category A**: Basic exercises (A001.py - A015.py)
- **Category B**: Intermediate exercises (B001.py - B010.py)
- **Category C**: Advanced exercises (C001.py - C029.py)
- **Category D**: Miscellaneous exercises (D001.py - D002.py)

Each script file corresponds to a unique exercise, and the files are named in a sequential format (e.g., `A001.py`, `A002.py`, etc.).
